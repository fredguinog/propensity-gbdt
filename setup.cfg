description = A causal inference toolkit for SCM, DiD and IPW. It uses Gradient Boosted Trees to estimate propensity scores and enforce common support by detecting and eliminating off-support control units. This pre-processing step ensures that the final effect estimation is more robust, credible, and less prone to bias.
