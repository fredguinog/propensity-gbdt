# propensity-gbdt
A causal inference toolkit for SCM, DiD, &amp; IPW. It uses Gradient Boosted Trees to estimate propensity scores and enforce common support by detecting and eliminating off-support control units. This pre-processing step ensures that the final effect estimation is more robust, credible, and less prone to bias.
